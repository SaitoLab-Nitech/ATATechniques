# ATATechniques

This is a test suite with anti-taint-analysis techniques discussed in our paper at [ARES 2021](https://www.ares-conference.eu/). Also, our journal paper has been published in August 2022, and we are preparing to open the new version of test suite used in the journal paper. **We will soon update this repository.**
